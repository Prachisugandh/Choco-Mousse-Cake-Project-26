Step #1: Pour the chocolate chips into a large bowl.  Microwave the cream, pour over the chips and let sit for a few minutes and stir

Step #2: Whip up the remaining cream.  Just plain cream.  Do not add sugar.  Feeling better about this now right?  It’s practically diet whip cream!

Step #3: Gently fold in a bit of the warm chocolate ganache to temper the cream.  Now add the remaining ganache to the cream and BOOM…you’ve got chocolate mousse!  And if you didn’t want a cake, you could pour this into small bowls for individual desserts.

Step #4: Layer chocolate graham crackers, chocolate mousse and repeat, ending with chocolate mousse.

Step 5:  Garnish with chopped chocolate chips that you set aside earlier.  Chill for 2 hours or overnight.  Can be made 3 days in advance
