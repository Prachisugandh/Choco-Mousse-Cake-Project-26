# Choco-mousse-cake
This is the cake that everyone will ask you to bring over and over again, and you won’t mind!  Cause it’s soooo easy to make and you get to lick the spoon.

I used 65% chocolate cacoa chips which are readily available in most grocery stores these days.  But semi-sweet chocolate chips work as well.
